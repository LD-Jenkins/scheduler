This project is now live at https://ld-jenkins.github.io/scheduler/ !



## Project Origins

From humble origins, this project came with some starter html and css and a note reading "Some Assembly Required".

## Design/Functionality

With some tender love and css, Bootstrap grid column layout, and some JS the project came to life.
The page now shows a multi-row style hour block layout running from 9AM to 5PM where a user may enter text in any hour block and click the adjacent save button to save that information within the browser.

If the user closes and re-opens the page any information entered will re-populate the approriate text fields where it may be further edited.

The top of the page also displays the current date and time.
